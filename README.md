# ETL in Python and SQL

## Course Overview
This repository contains the course materials for [**ETL in Python and SQL**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/etl-in-python-and-sql/), taught by Jennifer Ebe, a data engineer with over 5 years of experience. The course is designed to help you build robust systems that gather, transform, and store data efficiently for actionable insights. It focuses on:

- **Extracting Data**: Using Python to gather data from various sources.
- **Transforming Data**: Leveraging tools like pandas and SQL to explore, clean, and standardize data.
- **Loading Data**: Storing processed data in target systems.
- **Scheduling Jobs**: Automating ETL workflows with Python.

Each chapter includes hands-on challenges to reinforce learning through practical experience.
